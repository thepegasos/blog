I believe in contributing back to the world. Having spent 8 years in the idustry, I write about my learnings here with intent of sharing knowlegde with the world. 
My blogs here almost always come with learning materials that you can use to learn and understand the concept in depth. 

The materials include [Notes](about:blank) and Videos posted on my YouTube channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMS2faKYVNJXq0PcPM6VFJg). 

My usual cadence for blog is biweeky, but it can vary depending on my schedule from time to time. My focus is more toward the content quality rather than just adhering to the 
time-based schedule. If the topic does not meet the quality standards, I upload the video (for my reference down the lane) but keep it unlisted.
