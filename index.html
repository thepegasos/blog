I believe in contributing back to the world. Having spent 8 years in the idustry, I write about my learnings here with intent of sharing knowlegde with the world. 
My blogs here almost always come with learning materials that you can use to learn and understand the concept in depth. 

The materials include [Notes](about:blank) and Videos posted on my YouTube channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMS2faKYVNJXq0PcPM6VFJg). 

My usual cadence for blog is biweeky, but can vary depending on my schedule from time to time.
